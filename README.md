# Task Tracker CLI
A command-line expense manager that helps you track and organize your expenses.

## Description
This Python-based expense tracker is a simple way to manage your tasks through the command line. Expenses can be added, updated, and listed to the user (using Tabulate). All expenses are stored locally in a JSON file. I made this by following a Python roadmap, which can be found here https://roadmap.sh/projects/expense-tracker

## Features
* Add, update, and delete expenses
* List all expenses using Tabulate
